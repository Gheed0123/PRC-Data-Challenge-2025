**Files**
main_final.py - python script used to process and generate data from the flight trajectories (and run the model). Takes an hour or two to run.
model_final.py - script that makes an XGboost model and predicts the fuel use for the challenge. Perhaps a minute of runtime.
leaderboards.py - script that downloads leaderboard data and shows a couple of plots. Very nice. These looked better with fewer submissions

The rest of the files is pure data, source is free and accessible, link shown in the scripts.

It was a nice challenge, really enjoyed it!
